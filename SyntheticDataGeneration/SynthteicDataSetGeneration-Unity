Synthetic Dataset 1 — Baseline
Scripts Used

✅ No custom randomizers beyond defaults

Active Scripts / Components

PerceptionCamera

FixedLengthScenario

BoundingBox2DLabeler

What Was NOT Used

No camera randomizer

No lighting randomizer

No motion blur

No occluders

Resulting Data Characteristics

Static camera

Static tank

Consistent lighting

Clean bounding boxes

This dataset relied almost entirely on Unity’s static scene + perception export.

Synthetic Dataset 2 — Desert Generalization
New Scripts Added
1. Camera Pose Randomizer

Script

CameraRandomizer (custom or Perception-based)

Randomized Parameters

Camera angle

Camera height

Camera distance

Purpose

Prevent overfitting to a single viewpoint

2. Lighting Randomizer

Script

LightRandomizer

Randomized Parameters

Directional light rotation

Light intensity

Slight color temperature shifts

Purpose

Simulate outdoor desert lighting variation

Scripts Still NOT Used

No motion blur

No occlusion randomizer

Net Effect

Same clean environment as Dataset 1

Added viewpoint + lighting diversity

Improved real-world daylight performance

Synthetic Dataset 3 — Night / Low-Light
New Scripts Added (in addition to Dataset 2)
1. Aggressive Lighting Randomizer

Script

LightRandomizer (expanded ranges)

Changes

Much lower intensity range

Reduced ambient light

High contrast lighting

2. Motion Blur

Component

HDRP Motion Blur Volume Override

Purpose

Simulate camera motion + tracking blur

Camera Randomizer

Same script as Dataset 2

Larger movement ranges

What Was Still NOT Used

No occluder placement

Net Effect

Harder labels

Lower visibility

Increased training time

Improved low-light robustness

Synthetic Dataset 4 — Extreme Robustness (Multi-Sequence)

This dataset differed structurally and script-wise.

Structural Difference

Multiple Perception sequences

Each sequence:

Separate images/

Separate labels/

This mattered later in Colab when you had to iterate through sequences.

Scripts Added in Dataset 4
1. Occluder Randomizer

Script

ForegroundOccluderRandomizer (or custom occluder spawner)

Behavior

Random objects placed between camera and tank

Partial to severe occlusion

2. Extreme Camera Randomizer

Script

Same CameraRandomizer, but:

Larger position deltas

Faster movement

Less stable framing

3. Motion Blur (Aggressive)

Component

HDRP Motion Blur (higher intensity)

4. Mixed Lighting Randomizer

Script

LightRandomizer

Changes

Wide intensity range

Mixed medium → dark lighting

Inconsistent shadows

Net Effect

Lowest tank visibility

Noisy bounding boxes

Strong robustness learning

Risk of degrading clean-scene precision
